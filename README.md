## How to use TensorBoard:

Steps:
 - Install the Tensorboard library using pip: `pip install tensorboard` 
 - Use tensorboard to load the logs file, run in your command prompt: `tensorboard --logdir {path-to-logs}`

If you've opened your command prompt in the main project folder then you can use the relative path with the following command:

`tensorboard --logdir logs`

If it's working you should see the following output:

You can then either click on the link or open your browser and type it into the address bar which should load the tensorboard page:

## How to use Scripts

In main.py we are using Script objects to define which strategies we want to test and which models we want to test them on.
Scripts take five inputs as shown below:

- The neural network you want to use to run the tests with
- The artist that you want to use to output the results
- The list of strategies that you want to use (these are run separately)
- The datasets that you want to use (also run separately)
- The hyper-parameters to be used
