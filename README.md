## How to use TensorBoard:

Steps:
 - Install the Tensorboard library using pip: `pip install tensorboard` 
 - Use tensorboard to load the logs file, run in your command prompt: `tensorboard --logdir {path-to-logs}`

If you've opened your command prompt in the main project folder then you can use the relative path with the following command:

`tensorboard --logdir logs`

If it's working you should see the following output:

You can then either click on the link or open your browser and type it into the address bar which should load the tensorboard page:
